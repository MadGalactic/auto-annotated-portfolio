title: The Role of Customer Questionnaires in Building Trust
date: '2024-11-15'
excerpt: >-
  While questionnaires focus on communicating existing safeguards, risk
  assessments help us identify potential vulnerabilities and develop strategies
  to mitigate them. Let’s explore how we applied this process to a recent
  project with CloudGen DataVault, a new customer with access to sensitive data.

      When potential customers evaluate Symposia’s services, they often ask a
      key question: *“How do you protect our data?”* Answering this isn’t just
      about saying, “We take security seriously.” It’s about providing evidence
      through detailed customer questionnaires.


      For instance, one of our recent questionnaires covered critical areas such
      as:


      *   **Incident Response Plans:** We test our incident response plan
      annually to ensure we’re prepared for the unexpected.


      *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Required for all enterprise
      applications and production systems, ensuring an extra layer of protection
      for sensitive data.


      *   **Third-Party Risk Management:** Before sharing data with any third
      party, we perform a comprehensive risk assessment, which includes
      reviewing the vendor’s SOC 2 or ISO 27001 certifications and evaluating
      the data they’ll handle.


      *   **Employee Training:** Security awareness training is mandatory for
      all employees and third parties with privileged access, completed within
      two weeks of onboarding and refreshed annually.


      Each answer aligns with Symposia’s overarching commitment to industry
      standards like GDPR, ISO 27001, and SOC 2. This transparency not only
      satisfies customer concerns but also reinforces our reputation as a
      security-first organization.
